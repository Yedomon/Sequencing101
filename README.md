[Scaffolding explanation](https://youtu.be/RK0xDefnqB4?t=643)

> Contigs assembly alone is not enough in this case and we still need scaffolding of the contigs. We use Hi-C for long-range scaffolding and the Bionano optical map for short range scafolding. I will not go in the details here but basically Optical map is crucial for resolving some of the wrong chimeric contigs and it is also very good in ordering and orientating the scaffolds. Hi-C is very good to join contigs to give chromosome size scaffold

Can use this graph to compare sesamum indicum assemblies from china pangenome for the PhD.



The comparision of chromosome to a high quality reference genome is another way to check and compare genome assemblies. May use this plot to compare Goenbaek and Zhonzhi13 chromosomal scale assemblies in the phD document also

Just randomly get such an inspiring graph from [here](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2018.00660/full) showing comparative of pathogen genomes. Can be applied to my fungal genome project case.
